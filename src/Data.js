Together, we ventured into rural Oregon and stayed in a cute little Airbnb by the ZigZag River with our dog, Xena. During our stay, we went snowboarding at Mt. Hood Meadows and were thrilled to see the lack of crowds. Apparently the weather that week wasn't satisfactory enough for the locals but to us, the conditions were perfectly mild and made for a relaxing and secluded snowboarding adventure.",

This time around, I went with a mission. This time around I was one of the lucky few to score a Half Dome permit. This time around I would summit that iconic slab of rock.",

Everything from the kindness of the people here to the pedestrian/bike-centric infrastructure was magical. Our wonderful host, Hans let us borrow his bikes to cruise the city which we did for hours. We also paid a visit to the Paradiso theater for a local music festival featuring Steve Lacy. I must say, the people of Amsterdam are by far the kindest and most considerate concert-goers I've ever experienced. On our last day, we took a boat tour through the canals where Chris realized that he can only hold approximately 3.5 free beers in his bladder before asking the Captain to pull over for a quick pee break. Later, the Captain amused by the detour, told us that was the first time he had ever been asked to pull over in the middle of a tour. Amsterdam, please don't ever change.",

Shortly after stepping off the subway platform and emerging into the misty, cobble-stoned city, I felt as if I needed to create a love story of my own. Or rather, let Paris do the work for me. It was easy with a city as beautiful as this one. Together, Chris and I went on a tour of the Musée du Louvre, walked through the Jardin del Tuileries, saw the enchanting Sacre-Coeur, browsed through Van Gogh at Musée d'Orsay, walked to Arc de Triomphe, admired the stained glass windows at Sainte-Chapelle and so much more. Like I said, Paris makes being in love easy.",
